My [Cobbler Breakout](http://www.adafruit.com/products/914) came in a few days ago and I finally had the time to solder everything together. Here's the result:

Nothing too special, but it should help me get some cool projects to show off soon enough. (I also have a [LCD Display Breakout](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1115) waiting to get put together!).

I'm hoping to use this blog as a place to document some of the cool stuff I've been working on lately. If you're interested, feel free to subscribe [via RSS](/feed.xml) or follow me [on twitter](http://twitter.com/stevengattuso).
