point: cities are an inspiring place for me. They make me happy

After reading Matt Bunday's article, [Be Happy for No Reason](http://zencephalon.com/be-happy-for-no-reason.html), I was inspired to think about the things in my life that make me happy. One that's becoming increasingly prominent is moving to New York for the summer (six days from the time of writing this).

Anyone who knows me well enough will most likely be rolling their eyes at this point, as they'll know that I have always had an (almost weird) obsession with the city. For context, I come from a very small rural town called Hamilton in upstate New York. For 18 years of my life I was in a place 45 minutes away from the nearest major grocery store. Naturally, the city was such a massive change from this environment that whenever I visited, I was baffled by the civilization that I felt I was missing out on.

Maybe it's the feeling of being in a place the world cares about. Or a transit system that can zip me around to anywhere in the surrounding area within one nap's time. Or hearing a different language being spoken after each step on the street. Or a combination of all of these things that contrast so greatly from the place I originally lived. It's just a nice feeling being surrounded by such a vast amount of civilization.

Unfortunately I haven't been to many other cities, so these are most likely parts of life that aren't entirely unique to New York. I've been told repeatedly that New York is a disgusting shithole compared to other cities, but there's something I love about the nasty grime of its streets and subways. The occasional whiffs of sewer and homeless piss only make the delicious smells of its many restaurants and street vendors seem so much better. 

It's also incredible to be surrounded by people that are interested in the same things as me. I've always been into technology and programming, something that wasn't hugely popular in Hamilton. Thankfully I had the Internet to make up for any lack of interest in my town, which allowed me to learn how to program and connect with people I would otherwise have never known about (hello, Krisi!). However a physical community has something the Internet will never be able to fulfill. In the city I have the ability to be a part of a thriving tech community, filled with people who had similar interests and desires. There are hundreds of talks, meetups, parties, and events *just for technology*. There are so many interesting people to meet and so many opportunities to be had (this is also why I'm incredibly excited to see San Francisco some day), which is something I never got to experience in upstate New York.

It may seem like I regret growing up in my small town, but I definitely don't. Without those 18 years of isolation I would never be able appreciate everything the city has to offer. To me, going from my home to the city is like bringing Benjamin Franklin back from the 1700s. The complete darkness surrounding my house at night to the constant bustling of people and lights throughout in the city is a sharp contrast; one that's hard to not feel a shock from. Maybe that shock is the root of my happiness from the city. In fact, I've even noticed it when returning home. When I get back from visiting my brother's apartment (which is nested away among the massive buildings of the Financial District), I tend to appreciate the quietness and beauty of nature Hamilton has to offer. 

While I think the city is a better place for me personally, I can definitely see the appeal of living in a place like Hamilton. Neither is better than the other, just very different, and I'm glad I now have the option of picking between the two.

So now that I've gotten that off my chest, I'd like to propose an experiment. This summer I am incredibly grateful for being a part of the [hackNY Fellows Program](http://apply.hackny.org), which involves living and working in the city itself for 10 weeks. After those 10 weeks I'll be returning home, where I'd like to write a follow up post. I want to see if this feeling for the city lasts. Is it really as great of a place as I've let mind imagine it to be? In ~11 weeks time I'll hopefully have the answer.
